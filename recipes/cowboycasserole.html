    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This hearty cowboy casserole is comfort food at its best with a creamy filling and crispy tots.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices thick-cut bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped red bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound ground sirloin</li>
        <li>8 ounces hot pork country sausage (such as Jimmy Dean)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chopped garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) with a rack in the center position.</li>
        <li>Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium. Add bacon and cook, stirring often, until browned and crisp, about 7 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate with a slotted spoon, reserving 2 tablespoons of the drippings.</li>
        <li>Add onion and bell pepper to drippings in skillet; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high and add ground beef and sausage. Cook, stirring, until beef is crumbly, browned, and no longer pink, 6 to 8 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and drain fat, if desired. Stir in soup, milk, sour cream, salt, and black pepper. Stir in corn, bacon, and 1/2 cup of the cheese.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle top evenly with remaining 1 cup cheese and arrange tots in concentric circles over cheese layer (there will be about 1 1/2 cups tots leftover; reserve for another use).</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown and beef mixture is bubbly, about 35 minutes. Let sit for 5 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with parsley and serve hot.</li>
